This model is growing fast with e-commerce platforms where sellers may be required to pay some amount and buyer can buy 
it without paying anything. E-Commerce website brings the seller and buyer to the same platform. Analyzing the user's database 
will lead to understanding the business perspective. Behavior of the users can be traced in terms of business with exploration
 of the userâ€™s database.
